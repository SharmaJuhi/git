#Gitflow Workflow
With already created central repository, create a develop branch.
Other developers will clone the central repository and create a tracking branch for develop.
Developers needs to create their own feature branches.
As soon as one developer completes its feature branch, he/she will create new branch for the release.
Once release is ready to ship, it can be merged into master and develop, then release branch can be deleted.
